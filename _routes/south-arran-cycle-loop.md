summary: "This route around the south half of Arran includes a challenging climb up the string road and provides plenty of opportunities for spotting wildlife"

Beautiful coastline surrounds the entire island. This trip takes in the undulating south of the island and is possible to complete in one day, although it's worth taking your time and spending at least a couple of days soaking up the scenery."
